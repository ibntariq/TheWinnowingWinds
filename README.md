My first PHP and MySQL app
This is a simple blog app i made after learning PHP and MySQL, i also used jQuery, Ajax and JSON in this. All this does
is allow the author of the blog to create, view and delete his posts (I could have implemented the update post had I've gotten
time), if he is'nt logged in he'll just be allowed to view his posts, and once he loggs in he can create and delete.
Nothing fancy, just a start with PHP and MySQL.
